\chapter{Activity plan for the next period}\label{chp:plano}

In the final part of this project, we aim to do a deep study of some of the main methods of exponential integration for problems in dynamic systems, with emphasis on the paper \cite{Hochbruck2010}.

Here, the undergraduate will study the construction, analysis, implementation and application of them and at the end, it is expected that she is familiar with modern techniques of numerical methods.

Specific goals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Study the review para of Hochbruck and Ostermann \cite{Hochbruck2010} on numerical exponential integrators.
    \item Look into the main convergence theorems for exponential integration, based on references contained in Hochbruck and Ostermann \cite{Hochbruck2010}.
    \item Implement some idealized examples from the reference, looking into matrix exponential methods from Moler and Van Loan \cite{Moler2003}.
    \item Implement an exponential integration scheme for a 1D wave problem, possibly aiming at application to atmospheric waves.
\end{itemize}

This work is intended to be developed in collaboration between the FAPESP Thematic project on Dynamical Systems, led by the supervisor of this current proposal, Andr√© Salles de Carvalho, process 16/25053-8, and the FAPESP Young Investigator project on Numerical Methods, process 21/06176-0, led by a collaborator of this current proposal, Pedro S. Peixoto.
