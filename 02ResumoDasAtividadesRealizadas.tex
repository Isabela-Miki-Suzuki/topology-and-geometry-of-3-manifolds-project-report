\chapter{Summary of the activities}\label{chp:resumoAtiv}

In this project, we focused on the 3-sphere, an important 3-manifold, and were able to study it as a one-point compactification, subset of the quaternions, matrix group, union of disjoint circles, and as an union of "concentric" tori. For all that, it is necessary to know about inversions and möbius transformations, and that's how we will begin this report.

The main references were \cite{Andre}"Topologia e geometria de 3-variedades - Uma agradável introdução", from Carvalho and Siejakowski for the various aspects of the 3-sphere, \cite{Ahlfors} "Complex Analysis An Introduction to the Theory of Analytic Functions of One Complex Variable", from Ahlfors for the möbius transformations study and \cite{Coxeter} "Introduction to geometry", from Coxeter for Villarceau circles. More informations about these books can be found by the end of this document.
