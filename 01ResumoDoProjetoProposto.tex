\chapter{Summary of the proposed project}\label{chp:resumoProj} 

This project aims to study the topology and geometry of 3-manifolds and is based on the notes  \cite{Andre} "Topologia e Geometria de 3-variedades: Uma Agradável Introdução" ("Topology and Geometry of 3-manifolds: A Pleasant Introduction"), prepared by the advisor of this project in collaboration with Rafał Siejakowski, from IME-USP, to follow an introductory course of the same title at the 33rd Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium. Topics to be discussed include inversive geometry, the 3-sphere, and an introduction to geometric manifolds and structures in 2- and 3-manifolds.
